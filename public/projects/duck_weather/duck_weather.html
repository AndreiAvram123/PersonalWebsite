        <h2 class="text-black mt-5">Introduction</h2>
        <p>One of the app that I use on a daily basis is a weather app. However, simply because I do want to
            check the weather does not mean that I want to be overwhelmed by tons of unnecessary features and
            complicated interfaces, a thing which is very common among weather apps. It is that simple!
            Consequently, I have built a weather app myself, that is easy to use and offers no more than the
            basic set of features an user would want(however,I can always add more if requested).Thanks
            to an easy to use API that offers data in a JSON format, Dark Sky, it was easier than I thought it
            would be.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-black mt-5">Features</h2>
        <ul class="feature-list">
            <li>Current weather</li>
            <p>The main screen of the app is where you find the current weather displayed according
                to your location. The details included are current location,current time , temperature, humidity
                and recipitation chance.
            </p>
            <li>Daily weather</li>
            <p>The dark sky Api provided weather forecast for the following 7 days. Using the
                in the Daily section of the app you are presented with the min and max temperature of
                the next 7 days as well as the sunrise time and sunset time.
            </p>
            <li>Hourly weather</li>
            <p>The user is able to see the hourly temperature for the next 48 hours by going to the
                Hourly tab
            </p>
            <li>Change your location</li>
            <p>By utilizing the Google Maps api you are presented with a map on which you can
                change your current location to any one you want!
            </p>
        </ul>
