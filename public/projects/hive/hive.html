            <h2 class="text-black mt-5">Introduction</h2>
            <p>I have always loved going to coding competitions just for the simple reason that
                everyone comes up with a crazier idea each year. It is so pleasant to watch teams
                working and helping each other in order to bring their idea to life. Although, it is
                an only 24 hours competitions, it seems like building a working piece of software it
                is not that hard after all (though caffeine has its role as well)
            </p>
            <h2>Idea</h2>
            <p>For the hackaton we had to choose a certain challenge from the presented list. One challenge that
                looked appealing to us was te CO-OP one "Design a piece of software that would encourage people around
                your local area to help each other". After a long session of brainstorming we came up with this idea:
                "Let's encourage people around the local area to freely share their skills with others". This was the
                moment
                Hive was born.
            </p>
            <h2>Functionality</h2>
            <p>Once you log in into the app you are presented with a login screen. If you do not
                have an account you need to create one and we will verify your email in seconds(the database
                used was Firebase). When you create your account we kindly ask you to include at first, one interest
                (Spors, Music, Arts , Programming or Crafting) and a profile picture from a given galery that you can
                change later (although due to our talented designer I do not think you would want to replace that).
                <br> Next, you are good to go!
                <br> The app has three main screens: Learn, Teach and Map
                <ul class="feature-list">
                    <li>Learn</li>
                    <p>This is where you can see the interest you have chose for from the map.
                        You have at least one selected when you created your account.
                    </p>
                    <li>Teach </li>
                    <p>Interests you are willing to share with others. Once you add something here
                        everyone that has an account on our app can see your list on the map.</p>
                    <li>Map</li>
                    <p>The place where you interact with the world around you. Here
                        you can see people on the map with their profile picture and what they can
                        teach you. You select their profile and choose a skills you want to learn. Once
                        you added that skill it will instantly appear in your Learn section
                    </p>
                </ul>

                <h2>Hive - why this name?</h2>
                <p>Because Manchester of course ! In order to encourage the local popularity of the app we thought that
                    people that help each other are like bees in a hive. All for one and one for all. This was the
                    inspiration for the name of our team as well. We constantly presented ourselves to the judges as
                    being
                    "The bees"
                </p>
