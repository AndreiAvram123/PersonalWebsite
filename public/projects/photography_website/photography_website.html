            <h2 class="text-black mt-5">Introduction</h2>
            <p>I have decided to build a photography website because my best friend is a professional photographer who
                enjoys sharing her work with other people. She wanted someone to advertise her work on the internet and
                I thought I may be able to help her. She was really interested in hearing my intentions in building a
                website around her work and provided me with all the necessary content. Building this website was not
                only fun, but I also had a sense of accomplishment because I was able to help someone promote their
                work.

            </p>
            <div>
                <h2 class="text-black mt-5">Target audience</h2>
                <p>The first thing I thought about when starting to build my website was the target audience. Who is
                    going
                    to visit my website? After thinking a bit, I have decided that I am going to target people from the
                    UK
                    who are beginners in photography. From this decision, I have drawn the following piece of paper with
                    all
                    the things I have to keep in mind and build my website upon.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The website should include tutorials to help people learn how to take good pictures</li>
                    <li>The audience age is between 16 and 50</li>
                    <li>Their mother tongue is English</li>
                    <li>Most of them are accustomed to using technology on a daily basis</li>
                    <li>There is a small percentage of them who are colour blind and have disabilities</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Prototyping and first design</h2>
            <p>
                After wireframing and creating the site map, I thought it would be a good idea to make a working
                prototype of the website instead of going straight into coding the website. I decided to use a
                professional tool for designing, Adobe XD. This software also allowed me to create a working prototype
                of my website and linking pages together. Moreover, by creating a working prototype, I was able to do
                some user testing in the early stages of my project. The final website looks pretty similar to the
                working prototype with just some modification. The working prototype is available
                <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/565a5d22-13e5-433f-66b9-226a215090c0-206b/">here.</a>
            </p>
            <h2>Color scheme</h2>
            <p>According to experts
                , a dark
                colour scheme is more appropriate when designing websites for entertaining purposes or for media ones.
                Moreover, no matter what types of images, a dark colour scheme will always appear nice when combining
                with any type of image. Such examples include Netflix, Hulu or Spotify. I made sure that the text is
                readable under any circumstances by having white or blue text over the dark backgrounds.</p>
            <h2>Image resolution</h2>
            <p>The images on the website have a PPI of around 82. Web developers recommend a PPI of 72, but because this
                is a website dedicated to photography I have decided to implement a bit higher resolution. Because the
                images will take more space on a large device such as a monitor, I had to provide 3 different image
                sizes: for large devices, medium devices and small devices. I took the images I wanted to display on the
                website and used Photoshop’s option “Export for web” to resize all my images. However, I had made the
                following calculations for choosing the appropriate resolutions. The actual images do not have the exact
                same resolutions as shown below because I wanted to maintain their aspect ratio.
                I have created some images for medium screen devices that do not have screenshots here as well, but they
                are displayed when the screen width is between 768px and 992px. However, since tablets nowadays have
                bigger and bigger screen resolutions, the images for tables are the same size as those for desktop
                devices.</p>
