        <h2 class="text-black mt-5">Introduction</h2>
        <p>I have always been passionate about movies. I tend to go every single weekend to the cinema with my
            friends to see the latest and greatest movies that are currently on screen. One of the frequent apps
            that I am using is IMDb to see the description of a particular movie and its rating. One day,
            while using the app I thought that it would be an interesting idea to build up my own movie app from
            scratch. This is the moment Movio was born.

            <h2 class="text-black">Features</h2>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li>See popular and upcoming movies</li>
                <p>Once you login into the app you can see the two main screen, popular and upcoming movies.
                    Thanks to an easy and free to use API called The Movie DB you can get all sort of data
                    regarding movies or tv series.These two main screens are just a small example of what this API
                    is capable of.One feature that I am realy proud of is the ability to scroll down the list either
                    in
                    the popular or upcoming movies section and the app will load send another HTTP request to load
                    more movies into
                    the list.
                </p>
                <li>Search for a specific movie</li>
                <p>Users can get the relevant details about a movie with just a simple search in the app.The
                    app will send an HTTP request to the Movie API and get data regarding the search if available
                </p>
                <li>Save movies in your account</li>
                <p>Users can save their favorite movies for later offline use. I would say that this used to be
                    quite
                    a complicated feature to implement in Android in the past. However, with the new ROOM api,
                    storing
                    data will never be easier.Thanks Google </p>
