        <h2 class="text-black mt-5">Introduction</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite types of games is tower defence, especially ones that have something special
            like an alien theme in them. The mechanics of such a game are not complicated,usually, the player needs
            to
            defend his base agains waves of enemies by placing turrets in certain areas.
            One personality trait that I have is the passion to build things from scratch.
            My motto is "Why would you buy it when you can make it?"(you also learn a lot of things along the way
            and have fun).This was the starting point for this project(or I should say all my projects...).
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-black mt-5">Mechanics</h2>
        <p>As I said above, the mechanics of such a game are not complicated and my game is no
            exception from the rule.You have waves of enemies coming to attack your base and you must place
            defence towers around the map to protect it. Towers can be placed on red cubes on the map.
            However, I am still thinking about adding
            some extra features such as the ability for the player to freeze the enemies or maybe repair
            his base.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-black mt-5">Implementation</h2>
        <ul class="feature-list">
            <li>Breadth first search algorithm</li>
            <p>This is the main component that "powers my game". Using this algorithm I have given every enemy
                the ability to find a path to the player's base. In the Unity inspector I can simply mark
                an object as the player base and voila, the algorithm will then tell the enemy which path
                to take.But hold on! There is something special in this. Imagine the player being able
                to put a barier in the enemies'path. What's would happen next ? The algorithm will find
                a different way for the enemies to reach the player's base.
            </p>
            <li>Player Health system</li>
            <p>Every enemy that reaches the base will explode and decrease the life of the player.
                I have decided that once 5 enemies reach the base the game is over
            </p>
            <li>Enemy Health system</li>
            <p>Once an enemy has come within shooting range, a tower will start to fire. Depending
                on the how many towers are around the enemy might die instantly.
            </p>
            <li>Assets</li>
            <p>The theme of my game is defending a solar base from an enemy invasion. Because of
                these beautiful assets I managed to give my game exactly the look I wanted.
                <strong>However, I have to mention that the assets are not created by me.
                    These are free assets from Asset Store
                </strong>
            </p>
        </ul>
