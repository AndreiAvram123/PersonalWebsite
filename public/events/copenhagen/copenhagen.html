            <h2 class="text-black mt-5">Introduction</h2>
            <p>During the first year, the University of Salford along with other universities from Europe
                such as University of Applied Science Amsterdam or HOWEST organised a summer security school which
                was held in Copenhagen. Although, the summer school was mostly for second years student that
                already did some modules on security, for the few passionate programmers from first year the offer was
                more
                than welcomed.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2 class="text-black mt-5">The schedule</h2>
            <p>Each day there were both morning and afternoon sessions on security that covered specific topics.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monday - Ethics and Privacy / Social Engineering</li>
                <li>Tuesday - PenTesting / communication security</li>
                <li>Wednesday - Malware and reverse engineering / Blockchain (afterward we had a
                    boat trip, programmers need to relax right ?)
                </li>
                <li>Thursday -Capture the flag competition</li>
                <li>Friday -Capture the flag competition continued</li>
            </ul>
            <p> During the morning session we usually had a lecture on the specific topic from that particular day
                and in the afternoon a workshop in order to put into practice what we learned. I really enjoyed the
                fact that there was not that much theory at all, everything was just practical stuff</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2 class="text-black mt-5">Capture the flag competition and saving Copenhagen(wait what ?..)</h2>
            <p>As mentioned above in the schedule they gave us at the start of the week during the
                last 2 days there was a capture the flag competition. Most of us expected a classic one: someone gives
                you
                a server or a website and you have to find the Flag(usually a word). BUT NO! The organizers of the
                competition were a team of real hackers that participated almost every year in DEF CON (the biggest
                hacking competition in the world) and they came up with a crazy idea.<br>
                We have to stop a terrorist attack that was going to take place during the next 24 hours in Copenhagen
                using the information provided by them. When I say provided I mean that every team needed to have a person
                that was going to interrogate one of the organizers in a separate room(like a real case scenario)
                . What does that mean? Well, if you were not good enough in extracting information
                 then you would not know where to start...<br>
                Afterwards, you would have to do a lot of social engineering in order to find relevant information
                about the profile of the terrorist, when he was planning to do the attack etc.
            </p>

        <div>
            <h2 class="text-black mt-5">What happened next ?</h2>
            <p>Well, we saved Copenhagen! YEE! Well this is a very short summary of what happened in 24 hours.
                The teams had to go through a long process of applying all the skills leaned during the previous days
                in order to gather more and more details about the target. I do have to mention that we also had to go
                to a local bar and interrogate a person from the staff in order to get a certain piece
                of information( the organisers thought that it would be good
                to take a break from our screens).
            </p>

        <div>
            <h2 class="text-black mt-5">What I learned?</h2>
            <p>My programming skills in terms of security were greatly improved in just one week. I leaned
                about topics such as Malware detection, Social Engineering or Penetration testing. However, the most
                important part was that I managed to better work in a team. As I said, the last two days were only
                about the coding competition and we had to work in teams. Working with people from other countries that
                you had never met before is tricky right ?
