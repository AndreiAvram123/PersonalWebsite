            <p>HackManchester is an annual hackaton organised every year and takes place in the Museum of Science
                and
                Industry Manchester. People usually come here as part of a team of 4 and choose a specific challenge
                from a given list. Afterwards they
                have 24 hours to build at least a working prototype that would show that their
                idea can be implemented.Some of them struggle with the complexity of their idea while
                others simply get their head around and manage to build their fully working product in
                time. However, one thing is certain, everyone is having a good time(who knows..maybe for the
                caffeine
                buzz?).

            <h2>The Hive and The Bees</h2>
            <p>My team was composed by my friends from the University of Salford, 3 of us
                from Computer Science and the designer from Game design and Production.
                The skills in our team were mixed, some of us were very good at design while
                others were better at programming.<br>
                When it came to choosing a challenge, we thought that the one proposed
                by the Co-Op would be the most interesting one. The task was "Design a product that
                would incourage people from your local area to help each other".After some brainstorming
                and careful consideration our app, "The Hive" was born.<br>
                Why Hive and what's up with those bees?
                Because Manchester of course ! In order to encourage the local popularity of the app we thought that
                people that help each other are like bees in a hive. All for one and one for all. This was the
                inspiration for the name of our team as well. We constantly presented ourselves to the judges as
                being
                "The bees"

            <h2>After 24 hours of working...</h2>
            <p>Wow, after so much work it is finally done. We managed to build fully working
                Android app in just 24 hours along with a beautiful website to advertise
                our product.We felt very proud about it and the judges were pleased as well. Very
                few teams actually manage to go from an idea to an actually working product that can
                be deployed over multiple devices in just 24 hours. You can see the presentation below
                for more details and check the Hive article I wrote.
